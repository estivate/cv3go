# cv3go

cv3go is a go library for working with the [CV3 API](http://www.commercev3.com)

It has been developed to accomplish specific integrations, so certain API functions and fields
may not be included but should be trivial to add since the core connection and parsing is already
being done.

## Install

Run `go get` to download via git.

	go get github.com/estivate/cv3go

## Quick start

Use this library from your Go program like this but with your real credentials:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/cv3/cv3go"
)

func main() {
	cv3username, cv3password, cv3apiKey := "**********", "*********", "***********"

	log.Printf("Getting product ids from CV3\r\n")
	api := cv3go.NewApi()
	api.Debug = true
	api.SetCredentials(cv3username, cv3password, cv3apiKey)
	api.GetProductIds()
	data := api.Execute()
	fmt.Printf(string(data))
}
```

## Other Useful Snippits 

```go
	api.Debug = false // turn off all the XML printing and such
```

```go
	// get new orders, or a range or orders
	api.GetOrdersNew()
	// api.GetOrdersRange("20010156", "20010158")
	data := api.Execute()
	orders := api.UnmarshalOrders(data)
	log.Printf("Found %v pending orders\r\n", len(orders.Orders))
	for i := range orders.Orders {
		// ... do stuff with each order ...
	} 
```

```go
	// get catalog requests
	catalogs := api.GetCatalogRequestsNew()
	log.Printf("Found %v pending requests to process\r\n", len(catalogs.CatalogRequests))
	for i := range catalogs.CatalogRequests {
		log.Printf("Catalog Request #%v importing\r\n", catalogs.CatalogRequests[i].CatalogId)
	}
```


```go
	// get product details
	api.GetProductSingle("2231")
	data := api.Execute()
```

```go
	// confirm receipt of order (remove from pending)
	api.OrderConfirm("100082")
	data := api.Execute()
```

You will probably want to create a config file to store the authentication data in, since the password gets rotated a good bit and you'll need to pop in and update it occassionally. The Go Text Template library is very useful for formatting the CV3 data for a 3rd party system or vice versus. I often find myself grabbing data from CV3, pushing it through a Go Template and then submitting it to another API.
